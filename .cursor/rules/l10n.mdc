## Cursor Rules for String Descriptions (Internationalization & Accessibility)

This file outlines best practices for providing string descriptions for UI cursors, ensuring internationalization and accessibility.

### 1. Provide Meaningful and Contextual Descriptions

**Rule:** Cursor descriptions should clearly and concisely explain the action that will be performed when the user interacts with the element.

**When you should use:**

* For interactive elements like buttons, links, and form fields.
* When the visual representation of the element might not be self-explanatory.
* To reinforce the purpose of an element for all users.

### 2. Use Clear and Simple Language

**Rule:** Employ straightforward language, avoiding jargon or overly technical terms.

**When you should use:**

* For all cursor descriptions, ensuring they are easily understood by a broad audience.
* Especially important for users with cognitive disabilities or those who are not native speakers of the application's language.

### 3. Be Concise

**Rule:** Keep cursor descriptions brief and to the point.

**When you should use:**

* For all cursor descriptions to avoid overwhelming the user.
* Screen readers will typically read out the cursor description, so brevity improves the user experience.

### 4. Avoid Ambiguous Language

**Rule:** Ensure the cursor description clearly indicates the outcome of the interaction. Avoid phrases like "Click here" or "More."

**When you should use:**

* For all interactive elements. Instead of "Click here," use descriptions like "Submit form" or "Open document."

### 5. Localize All Cursor Descriptions

**Rule:** Every cursor description must be translated into all supported languages of the application.

**When you should use:**

* In all internationalized applications.
* Store translatable strings in external resource files, separate from the code.

### 6. Account for Text Expansion

**Rule:** When localizing, be mindful that text length can vary significantly between languages. Ensure UI elements can accommodate longer descriptions without truncation or layout issues.

**When you should use:**

* During the design and development phases of internationalized applications.
* Test with various languages to identify potential layout problems.

### 7. Support Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages

**Rule:** For languages that read from right to left (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew), ensure that the cursor descriptions and the overall UI layout are mirrored correctly.

**When you should use:**

* In applications that support RTL languages.

### 8. Use Unicode for Global Compatibility

**Rule:** Utilize Unicode to ensure proper rendering of characters across different languages and character sets.

**When you should use:**

* In all applications to support a wide range of languages.

### 9. Test with Assistive Technologies

**Rule:** Regularly test the application with screen readers and other assistive technologies to ensure that cursor descriptions are properly conveyed and enhance accessibility.

**When you should use:**

* Throughout the development process and before releasing new versions of the application.

### 10. Consider Cultural Sensitivity

**Rule:** Be aware that certain words or phrases might have different connotations or be offensive in different cultures.

**When you should use:**

* When writing and translating cursor descriptions for a global audience.
* Collaborate with localization experts to ensure cultural appropriateness.

By following these guidelines, you can create a more accessible and user-friendly experience for everyone using your application, regardless of their language or abilities.
