- When using "library" directives, you should not add a name as that is depreciated. Example: 

```plaintext

Instead of: 

library buttons;

You would just use

`library;`
```

- Make sure to always use "FlexBox" https://www.fluttermix.com/docs/widgets/flex:



- `withOpacity` is deprecated, and you should follow the pattern as laid out in the example: 

```plaintext
'withOpacity' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Use .withValues() to avoid precision loss.
```

Always consider localisation when you're creating features.
